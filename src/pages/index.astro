      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate developer and musician who loves creating innovative
        applications that bridge the gap between technology and creativity. My
        work focuses on building interactive experiences that inspire and engage
        users.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with synthesizers,
        composing music, or exploring new technologies that push the boundaries
        of what's possible on the web.
